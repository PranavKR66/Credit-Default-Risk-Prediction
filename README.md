# Credit-Default-Risk-Prediction
**The goal of the project is to predict whether or not a customer will deafult on their loan. 
The dataset used for this project was part of a Kaggle competition sponsored by Home Credit.**

- **Performed exploratory data analysis in Python on a data set consisting of 370,000 rows, using statistical analysis and visualization. Performed feature engineering by aggregating and merging multiple data sources.**
- **Dealt with outliers and missing values in the data using techniques like winsorization and Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE).**
- **Implemented machine learning algorithms like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression.**
- **Used Grid Search and k-fold cross validation to tune the hyper-parameters in order to optimize the recall of the models. Made predictions with recall and AUC values of around 72 and 85 percent, respectively.**
- **Built an interactive dashboard using plotly dash in python. Used joblib files to serialize trained models. Deployed the serialized models and app to the Heroku cloud server.**
